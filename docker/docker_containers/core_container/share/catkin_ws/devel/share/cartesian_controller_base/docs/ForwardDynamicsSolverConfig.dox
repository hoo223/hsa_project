\subsubsection parameters ROS parameters

Reads and maintains the following parameters on the ROS server

- \b "~link_mass" : \b [double] Virtual mass of the manipulator's links. The smaller this value, the more does the end-effector (which has a unit mass of 1) dominate dynamic behavior. Near singularities, a bigger value leads to smoother motion. min: 0.001, default: 0.01, max: 1.0
